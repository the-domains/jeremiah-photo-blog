  Tami and Chase Spenst wanted to build a one-stop shop for the everyday bicycle
  rider. After finding a space in the heart of Los Angeles' creative community,
  they designed a warm and approachable indoor/outdoor space (with a service
  center and coffee bar) and filled it with vintage-inspired bicycles and
  accessories.
